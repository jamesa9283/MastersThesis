In this thesis, we discuss and present ideas surrounding fluid flow on manifolds. We model fluid flow as a Fr\'echet group of structure-preserving diffeomorphisms and use Euler-Poincar\'e and Lie-Poisson reduction to derive geodesic equations. We then study the conservation quantities of these equations using (Kelvin-)Noether Theorems and Casimir Theory.
